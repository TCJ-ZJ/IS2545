# IS2545 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing

### Development Evironment

>IDE: *Eclipse*

>JDK: *JAVA SE 7[1.7.0_79]*

>Test Tool: *JUnit 4*


### ISSUE
1. I'm not a java programmer before, so, it hard to me to write this java program.

2. In requirement, there is a seed for random function, as begin, I even don't know what it mean. After find some source online, I get the result;
```java
  Random ran = new Random(seed);
  int num = ran.nextInt(bound);
```
